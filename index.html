    <p>ðŸ‘‰Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907[2][a] â€“ 23 March 1931) was an Indian anti-colonial revolutionary[3] who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in December 1928[4] in what was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.[</p>
    <p>ðŸ‘‰] He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, whichâ€”on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapersâ€”turned him into a household name in the Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.[6] Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism,[7] the charismatic Bhagat Singh</p>
    <p>ðŸ‘‰In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, both members of a small revolutionary group, the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (also Army, or HSRA), shot dead a 21-year-old British police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was still on probation, for the British senior police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had intended to assassinate.</p>
    <p>ðŸ‘‰Bhagat Singh was convicted of the murder of John Saunders and Channan Singh, and hanged in March 1931, aged 23.</p>
